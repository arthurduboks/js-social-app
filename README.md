# Vanilla JavaScript Full-Stack Project

A Full-Stack application built using Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It provides a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality through MongoDB and features a real-time chat system using Socket.IO. Special attention has been given to security aspects, including protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSURF).

## Features
